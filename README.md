### Web Automation And Testing :- Selenium

![Testing](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*nxIlcc-RJSOq_PgE5GMo0A.png)

Selenium is written using Java but we have it python binding as well. So selenium is actually a web automaton tool which simply means that it can automate your browser.

Selenium needs something called a web-driver. Every browser has its own driver. So in this way we can use the particular web-driver of the particular web browser and automate it.

## Error
So many times the problem is that when browser is made small. Selenium is unable to know the correct position of html elements.So better use 
browser.maximize_window()
